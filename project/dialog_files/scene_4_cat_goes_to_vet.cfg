main_vet: What brings you in today?
lucrecia: She’s sick! I dunno, just make her better. And fast!
lucrecia: I don’t have all day to be stuck here in this dreary place.
main_vet: Well.. let me see what I can do….
main_vet: Hmm. Based on the symptoms it could very well be a foreign object.
main_vet: But I can’t seem to feel anything by palpitating.
main_vet: I’m gonna have to perform exploratory surgery just in case it’s a blockage.
main_vet: These kinds of things can very well kill a cat, y’know?
lucrecia: You’re joking!? What kind of bill is that gonna run me?

main_vet: Well I have great news Miss!
main_vet: So sorry for the wait. But I located the source of all our troubles…
main_vet: a singular googly eye.
main_vet: What a fuss she made over such a tiny thing. But she should be spick and span now!
main_vet: Just do be careful in the future leaving objects such as this lying around, she seems like an extra curious kitty!
lucrecia: Don’t worry, I’ll give her a stern scolding back at home.
lucrecia: I can assure you we WON’T be coming back. I’ll make sure of it.
main_vet: Oh well I sure hope not! Run along now.
